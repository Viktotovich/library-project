# library-project

This is my first take on the library project, I am not satisfied with the results. Given time and more practice, I will re-visit this for a library 2.0, better and more efficient.

The worst mistake made in this code is using the classic for loop instead of the forEach loop, which has proven detrimental to my ability to alter keys such as the read/not-read, and hindered my ability to make an efficient long term storage array - having to resort to a cheap alternative; antiDuplicateArray[].

Overall, I am sad - I wish I had more time to work on this, but due to having to work full time while working on this- I wasn't able to give it my all without feeling the need to rush (to get enough sleep).
